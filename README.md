# WePair Health
## My portfolio is the work I accomplished at WePair Health, a dynamic and intuitive platform that connects community healthcare workers with exceptional healthcare providers, emphasizing job flexibility, pay transparency, and zero fees. WePair Health is currently in its MVP stage. Due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can provide only code snippets. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the onboarding process for healthcare organizations. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my tasks.

* Developed a user-friendly Organization form using React.js, Bootstrap, Formik, and Yup.
* Built SQL/T-SQL procedures and tables for efficient access to organization data.
* Deployed .NET Core APIs for smooth integration between back-end and front-end.
* Added content management features to improve user interface.
* Used model binding in ASP.NET for reliable data management.
* Debugged issues in React using various techniques.
* Applied debugging tools in .NET and Postman.
* Conducted API testing with Postman, Visual Studio, and Chrome DevTools.
* Managed code versions and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
* Actively participated in AGILE routines to enhance code quality and teamwork.
